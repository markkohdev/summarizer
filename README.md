# Summarizer

A tool for turning daily voice transcripts into task-grouped markdown summaries.

### Why this exists:

- **Task-Grouped**: Groups notes by task rather than by date. If you work on something across multiple days, it's a single bullet.
- **Context-Aware**: Includes prior days' context to stitch multi-day efforts together.
- **Interactive Refinement**: Optional feedback loop to refine summaries with more/less detail, corrections, or different focus.
- **LLM-Powered**: Supports OpenAI and Gemini models for summarization.

## Installation

Install with `uv` (recommended):

```shell
cd summarizer
uv sync
```

Or with pip:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Summarize transcripts for a single date:

```shell
summarizer 2025-09-10 --input-dir ~/path/to/transcripts
```

Or a date range:

```shell
summarizer 2025-09-08:2025-09-10 --input-dir ~/path/to/transcripts
```

With interactive refinement:

```shell
summarizer 2025-09-10 --input-dir ~/path/to/transcripts --interactive
```

The tool expects JSON files with a `text` field containing transcripts. It'll parse filenames to extract dates.

### Options

- `--provider` - LLM provider: `openai` or `gemini` (default: `openai`)
- `--model` - Model name (default: `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `--api-key` - API key (otherwise reads from env: `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- `--context-days` - Days of prior context to include (default: 14)
- `--max-chars` - Soft limit on prompt size (default: 120000)
- `--interactive` - Enable interactive refinement mode
- `--max-iterations` - Max refinement iterations (default: 5)

### Output Format

Summaries are task-grouped markdown with:
- A short 2-3 sentence overview
- **Tasks Completed** - Things you finished
- **Remaining Action Items** - Things still in progress

Example:

```markdown
## Multi-Day Summary 2025-09-08 â†’ 2025-09-10
Worked on model training pipeline improvements and data quality issues. 
Completed the feature extraction refactor. Still working on experiment 
framework updates and documentation.

### Tasks Completed
- Refactored feature extraction pipeline for better performance (09-08, 09-09)
- Fixed data validation bug in preprocessing step (09-10)

### Remaining Action Items
- Update experiment tracking framework (09-08, 09-09)
- Complete technical documentation for new pipeline (09-09, 09-10)
