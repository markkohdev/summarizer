SUMMARY_TEMPLATE = """
You are summarizing transcripts for a knowledge worker.

Summarize the TARGET WINDOW first, but use CONTEXT notes to stitch multi-day efforts.

STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS MARKDOWN FORMAT (no preamble, no extra headings):
--------------------------------
{title_line}
<Short 2-3 sentence summary of the major items>

### Tasks Completed
- <Short 1-2 sentences describing task 1> (<note ID[s]>)
- <Short 1-2 sentences describing task 2> (<note ID[s]>)
- ...

### Remaining Action Items
- <Short 1-2 sentences describing action item 1> (<note ID[s]>)
- <Short 1-2 sentences describing action item 2> (<note ID[s]>)
- ...

--------------------------------
Rules:
- You should try to capture all tasks discussed in the notes, but don't
  overinflate the summary with too many tiny tasks.
- Group by TASK, not by date. If the same task appears across multiple days,
  output ONE bullet and optionally indicate the days in parentheses.
- You shouldcapture the main points of the tasks, but don't be overly simple
  to the point of being useless.
- Consider a task *completed* if ANY note indicates completion (e.g.,
  "finished", "completed", "finished", "done", "shipped", "fixed", "updated",
  etc.).  Otherwise keep as an action item.
- Keep bullets concise (<= 50 words when possible for simple items) and
  informative.  Include the most relevant note IDs for each bullet.
- Use the exact note IDs shown below (filenames). Do not fabricate IDs.
- Only include items that appear in the notes.

TARGET WINDOW: {target_start} to {target_end} (inclusive)
CONTEXT WINDOW: {context_start} to {target_end} (inclusive)
